# .NET CLI Tool Architecture Guide

A layered architecture for .NET console/CLI applications with clear separation between entry point, business logic, and tests. Designed for command-line tools that perform file system operations, data processing, database operations, or automation tasks. Emphasizes testability through dependency injection, the Command/Strategy pattern, and a strict layered structure.

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| .NET | 8.0+ | Runtime and SDK |
| CommandLineParser | 2.9.1 | CLI argument parsing |
| NUnit | 4.3.2 | Unit and integration testing |

## When to Use This Architecture

- Command-line tools for file system operations or data processing
- Database migration or administration tools
- Automation scripts requiring structured error handling
- CLI tools with dry-run / what-if mode
- Projects needing strict layered separation for testability

## When NOT to Use This Architecture

- Desktop applications with a GUI (use dotnet-avalonia-clean-architecture)
- Web applications (use ASP.NET)
- Simple one-off scripts (use python-uv-app)
- Tools that need Roslyn code analysis (use dotnet-roslyn-code-analyzer)
